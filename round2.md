Round 2
-------

In round 2 you get a bonus (the grey bits on the plot) if you're uncertain, regardless of 
whether you're right or wrong. The bonus is highest in the middle decreasing to zero at 
the ends.

You still get the most points if you win while the slider is at 100% confidence, and you still 
lose the most if you lose at 100% confidence.
