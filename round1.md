Round 1
-------

In round 1, you get the most points if you move the slider all the way to 100% confidence and 
get it right. But you also lose the most points if you go to 100% and get it wrong.

If you stay in the middle, though, you get nothing. Moving half way left or 
right, you get half the points available if you're right and lose half the points if you're wrong.
