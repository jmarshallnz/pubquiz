Quizzing with confidence
========================

Welcome to the Confidence Quiz, where you'll learn to answer questions with confidence (or at 
least to confidently supply your lack of confidence!)

There are two rounds each containing 10 questions with two possible answers A and B. Drag the 
slider to the left for A and to the right for B. Try and position the slider so you get the 
most points you can in total.
