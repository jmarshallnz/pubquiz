Summary

Hopefully you would have found that the uncertainty bonus made you think more about how 
uncertain you are, as you get more points if you find a balance between getting maximum 
points and losing points in the case that you were wrong.

Without the uncertainty bonus, if you don't know anything and guess all the time, it doesn't 
matter what confidence you specify as on average you'll win and lose half the time. With the 
uncertainty bonus you score more if you stay in the middle. Thus, the uncertainty bonus helps 
us to accurately specify how uncertain we are about the answers.

Making sure that we describe uncertainty accurately is important in many areas of statistics
such as weather or financial forecasting, and rules such as the one used in round 2 have been 
shown to be optimal at ensuring uncertainty is as accurately specified as possible.
